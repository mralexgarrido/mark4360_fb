  // Campaign Step
  campaignName: {
    title: "Campaign Name",
    content: "Naming your campaign clearly is the first step in organization. In a professional setting, naming conventions often include the Client Name, Objective, Year, and Quarter (e.g., 'Nike_Traffic_Q3_2023'). This makes it easy to search for and analyze campaigns later."
  },
  buyingType: {
    title: "Buying Type",
    content: "There are two main ways to buy ads on Facebook:\n\n• **Auction**: This is the standard buying type. You bid against other advertisers to reach your audience. The cost varies based on demand and competition.\n\n• **Reach and Frequency**: This allows you to book campaigns in advance with predictable reach and frequency settings. It's often used by large brands for brand awareness campaigns where they want to guarantee a specific number of people see their ad."
  },
  spendingLimit: {
    title: "Campaign Spending Limit",
    content: "A campaign spending limit is an optional cap on the total amount you want to spend for this specific campaign. It prevents you from accidentally overspending if you have multiple campaigns running simultaneously. Once the limit is reached, all ads in the campaign stop running."
  },
  campaignObjective: {
    title: "Campaign Objective",
    content: "Your objective determines who Facebook shows your ads to. Their algorithm optimizes for the result you pick.\n\n• **Awareness**: Show your ads to people most likely to remember them.\n• **Traffic**: Send people to a destination, like your website, app, or Instagram event.\n• **Sales**: Find people likely to purchase your product or service.\n\nChoosing the wrong objective is a common mistake. If you want sales, don't choose 'Traffic'—optimize for the actual conversion."
  },
  specialCategory: {
    title: "Special Ad Categories",
    content: "Ads related to Credit, Employment, Housing, or Social Issues have restricted targeting options to prevent discrimination. For example, you cannot target by age, gender, or zip code for housing ads."
  },

  // Ad Set Step
  budget: {
    title: "Budget Strategy",
    content: "• **Daily Budget**: The average you'll spend each day. Good for evergreen campaigns that run continuously.\n• **Lifetime Budget**: The maximum you'll spend for the entire duration of the ad set. Good for limited-time promotions. This also unlocks 'Ad Scheduling' (dayparting), allowing you to run ads only at specific times of day."
  },
  startDate: {
    title: "Start Date",
    content: "Scheduling your ads allows you to control exactly when they go live. For time-sensitive promotions, ensure your start date aligns with your launch. You can schedule ads to start in the future."
  },
  endDate: {
    title: "End Date",
    content: "Setting an end date is crucial for preventing runaway spend. It ensures your campaign stops automatically after your promotion or budget period ends. If you leave this blank, the ad runs until you manually turn it off or hit your spending limit."
  },
  audience: {
    title: "Audience Definition",
    content: "This is one of the most powerful features of Facebook Ads.\n\n• **Core Audiences**: Targeting based on demographics (age, gender), location, interests, and behaviors.\n• **Custom Audiences**: Retargeting people who have already engaged with your business (e.g., visited your website, watched a video).\n• **Lookalike Audiences**: New people who share similar characteristics to your best existing customers."
  },
  locations: {
    title: "Locations",
    content: "You can target people living in or recently in a location. You can be as broad as a country or as specific as a 1-mile radius around a pin drop. This is crucial for local businesses."
  },
  ageRange: {
    title: "Age Range",
    content: "Targeting the right age group ensures your budget isn't wasted on people unlikely to be interested. Consider your customer persona's typical age demographic. Note: For certain special categories (Housing, Credit, Employment), age targeting is restricted."
  },
  gender: {
    title: "Gender",
    content: "While many products are gender-neutral, some specific items (like women's apparel or men's grooming) perform better with gender-specific targeting. Always test if excluding a gender lowers your cost per result."
  },
  detailedTargeting: {
    title: "Detailed Targeting",
    content: "Detailed targeting allows you to reach people based on interests (e.g., 'Yoga'), behaviors (e.g., 'Frequent Travelers'), or demographics. \n\n**Tip:** Avoid narrowing your audience too much. A broader audience often allows the algorithm to find the best people at a lower cost."
  },

  // Ad Creative Step
  facebookPage: {
    title: "Facebook Page",
    content: "Your Facebook Page is your business's identity on the platform. Ads must run from a verified page, which adds credibility to your advertisement. Users can click through to your page to see your organic posts."
  },
  instagramAccount: {
    title: "Instagram Account",
    content: "Linking an Instagram account allows you to run ads on Instagram Feed, Stories, and Reels under your brand's handle. If you don't connect one, your Facebook Page name and logo will be used for Instagram placements."
  },
  creativeFormat: {
    title: "Ad Format",
    content: "Different formats serve different storytelling needs.\n\n• **Single Image**: Simple and effective. Focuses on one strong visual.\n• **Carousel**: Allows you to showcase up to 10 images or videos, each with its own link. Great for showing multiple products or telling a step-by-step story.\n• **Video**: generally has higher engagement rates. Short, vertical videos (Reels) are currently very effective."
  },
  imageUrl: {
    title: "Ad Image",
    content: "Visuals are the first thing users see. High-quality, relevant images stop the scroll. \n\n**Best Practice:** Ensure your image has less than 20% text. Facebook's algorithm penalizes images with too much text, reducing your reach."
  },
  primaryText: {
    title: "Primary Text",
    content: "This appears above the image on Facebook and below it on Instagram. The first sentence (the 'hook') is critical. It should address a pain point or grab attention immediately before the text is truncated with 'See More'."
  },
  headline: {
    title: "Headline",
    content: "On Facebook, this appears in bold next to the CTA button. It should be short, punchy, and reinforce the main offer or benefit (e.g., '50% Off - This Week Only')."
  },
  description: {
    title: "Description",
    content: "The description appears below the headline in some placements (like Desktop News Feed). Use it to provide secondary details, social proof, or urgency (e.g., 'Over 10,000 satisfied customers' or 'Offer ends midnight')."
  },
  websiteUrl: {
    title: "Website URL",
    content: "This is the destination where users land after clicking. Ensure it is mobile-optimized and relevant to the ad content. Sending users to a specific product page usually converts better than sending them to your homepage."
  },
  callToAction: {
    title: "Call To Action (CTA)",
    content: "The button on your ad. Ads with a clear CTA perform significantly better than those without. 'Learn More' is often the best performing soft CTA, while 'Shop Now' is better for direct intent."
  }
};
