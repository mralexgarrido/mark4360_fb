  // Campaign Step
  campaignName: {
    title: "Campaign Name",
    content: "Naming your campaign clearly is the first step in organization. In a professional setting, naming conventions often include the Client Name, Objective, Year, and Quarter (e.g., 'Nike_Traffic_Q3_2023'). This makes it easy to search for and analyze campaigns later."
  },
  buyingType: {
    title: "Buying Type",
    content: "There are two main ways to buy ads on Facebook:\n\n• **Auction**: This is the standard buying type. You bid against other advertisers to reach your audience. The cost varies based on demand and competition.\n\n• **Reach and Frequency**: This allows you to book campaigns in advance with predictable reach and frequency settings. It's often used by large brands for brand awareness campaigns where they want to guarantee a specific number of people see their ad."
  },
  campaignObjective: {
    title: "Campaign Objective",
    content: "Your objective determines who Facebook shows your ads to. Their algorithm optimizes for the result you pick.\n\n• **Awareness**: Show your ads to people most likely to remember them.\n• **Traffic**: Send people to a destination, like your website, app, or Instagram event.\n• **Sales**: Find people likely to purchase your product or service.\n\nChoosing the wrong objective is a common mistake. If you want sales, don't choose 'Traffic'—optimize for the actual conversion."
  },
  specialCategory: {
    title: "Special Ad Categories",
    content: "Ads related to Credit, Employment, Housing, or Social Issues have restricted targeting options to prevent discrimination. For example, you cannot target by age, gender, or zip code for housing ads."
  },

  // Ad Set Step
  budget: {
    title: "Budget Strategy",
    content: "• **Daily Budget**: The average you'll spend each day. Good for evergreen campaigns that run continuously.\n• **Lifetime Budget**: The maximum you'll spend for the entire duration of the ad set. Good for limited-time promotions. This also unlocks 'Ad Scheduling' (dayparting), allowing you to run ads only at specific times of day."
  },
  audience: {
    title: "Audience Definition",
    content: "This is one of the most powerful features of Facebook Ads.\n\n• **Core Audiences**: Targeting based on demographics (age, gender), location, interests, and behaviors.\n• **Custom Audiences**: Retargeting people who have already engaged with your business (e.g., visited your website, watched a video).\n• **Lookalike Audiences**: New people who share similar characteristics to your best existing customers."
  },
  locations: {
    title: "Locations",
    content: "You can target people living in or recently in a location. You can be as broad as a country or as specific as a 1-mile radius around a pin drop. This is crucial for local businesses."
  },

  // Ad Creative Step
  creativeFormat: {
    title: "Ad Format",
    content: "Different formats serve different storytelling needs.\n\n• **Single Image**: Simple and effective. Focuses on one strong visual.\n• **Carousel**: Allows you to showcase up to 10 images or videos, each with its own link. Great for showing multiple products or telling a step-by-step story.\n• **Video**: generally has higher engagement rates. Short, vertical videos (Reels) are currently very effective."
  },
  primaryText: {
    title: "Primary Text",
    content: "This appears above the image on Facebook and below it on Instagram. The first sentence (the 'hook') is critical. It should address a pain point or grab attention immediately before the text is truncated with 'See More'."
  },
  headline: {
    title: "Headline",
    content: "On Facebook, this appears in bold next to the CTA button. It should be short, punchy, and reinforce the main offer or benefit (e.g., '50% Off - This Week Only')."
  },
  callToAction: {
    title: "Call To Action (CTA)",
    content: "The button on your ad. Ads with a clear CTA perform significantly better than those without. 'Learn More' is often the best performing soft CTA, while 'Shop Now' is better for direct intent."
  }
